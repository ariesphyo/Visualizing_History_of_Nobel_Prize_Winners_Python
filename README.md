# Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners in Python

Welcome!
This Nobel prize winner project is part of my learning journey as a data analyst at DataCamp.

## Project Description 

The Nobel Foundation has provided a dataset containing all Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023. For this project, the dataset comes from the Nobel Prize API and is stored in the file named "nobel.csv". The analysis performs the following tasks: 

1. What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?
2. Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?
3. Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
4. Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
5. Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
